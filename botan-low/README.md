# Welcome to botan-low

Low-level bindings to the [Botan](https://botan.randombit.net/) cryptography library.

> Botan's goal is to be the best option for cryptography in C++ by offering the
> tools necessary to implement a range of practical systems, such as TLS
> protocol, X.509 certificates, modern AEAD ciphers, PKCS#11 and TPM hardware
> support, password hashing, and post quantum crypto schemes.

For more information, see the [README on Github](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/botan)
