{- $introduction

Key agreement is a scheme where two parties exchange public keys, after which
it is possible for them to derive a secret key which is known only to the two
of them.

There are different approaches possible for key agreement. In many protocols,
both parties generate a new key, exchange public keys, and derive a secret,
after which they throw away their private keys, using them only the once.
However this requires the parties to both be online and able to communicate
with each other.

In other protocols, one of the parties publishes their public key online in
some way, and then it is possible for someone to send encrypted messages to
that recipient by generating a new keypair, performing key exchange with the
published public key, and then sending both the message along with their
ephemeral public key. Then the recipient uses the provided public key along
with their private key to complete the key exchange, recover the shared secret,
and decrypt the message.

Typically the raw output of the key agreement function is not uniformly
distributed, and may not be of an appropriate length to use as a key. To
resolve these problems, key agreement will use a Key Derivation Functions (KDF)
on the shared secret to produce an output of the desired length.

{- $usage

First, Alice and Bob generate their private keys:

> import Botan.Low.PubKey
> import Botan.Low.PubKey.KeyAgreement
> import Botan.Low.RNG
> import Botan.Low.Hash
> import Botan.Low.KDF
> rng <- rngInit "system"
> -- Alice creates her private key
> alicePrivKey <- privKeyCreate ECDH Secp521r1 rng
> -- Bob creates his private key
> bobPrivKey <-  privKeyCreate ECDH Secp521r1 rng

Then, they exchange their public keys using any channel, private or public:

> -- Alice and Bob exchange public keys
> alicePubKey <- keyAgreementExportPublic alicePrivKey
> bobPubKey <- keyAgreementExportPublic bobPrivKey
> -- ...

Then, they may separately generate the same agreed-upon key and a randomized,
agreed-upon salt:

> salt <- rngGet rng 4
> -- Alice generates her shared key:
> aliceKeyAgreement <- keyAgreementCreate alicePrivKey (kdf2 SHA256)
> aliceSharedKey    <- keyAgreement aliceKeyAgreement bobPubKey salt
> -- Bob generates his shared key:
> bobKeyAgreement   <- keyAgreementCreate bobPrivKey (kdf2 SHA256)
> bobSharedKey      <- keyAgreement bobKeyAgreement alicePubKey salt
> -- They are the same
> aliceSharedKey == bobSharedKey
> -- True

> WARNING: There used to be a memory leak in keyAgreement. Please
> report this bug to the maintainers if it returns.
